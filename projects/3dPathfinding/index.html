                This project was my first attempt at building a small game engine using DirectX11 and WinAPI.  
                I implemented a window and input system, basic rendering of multiple geometries, navigation meshes, and A* pathfinding.  
                The project helps with performance evaluation of A* pathfinding in 3D space and provides visualization of AI navigation.

                The navigation meshes in this project were generated using a simple slope filter, which is a basic step in creating navigable surfaces.  
                While more advanced techniques can produce higher-quality meshes, the simplicity of the current approach results in a higher density than would be practical for a full-scale engine.  
                Additionally, the implementation is vertex-based, which further increases the density of the graph.  
                A more efficient method could operate over polygon centroids and evaluate shortest paths across the resulting set of convex polygons using the funnel algorithm.  
                Despite this, the pathfinding implementation performs exceptionally well, with execution times in the microsecond range, and offers ample room for further optimization.  
                With improvements, this approach could be suitable for professional use.
